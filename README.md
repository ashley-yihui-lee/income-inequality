# When Gender Meets Native Identity: The Income Gap for Native Women

This project explores income disparities among Native American women, highlighting the intersectionality of gender, race, and geography in economic inequality. The data story utilizes visualizations and analysis based on the **Income Distributions and Dynamics in America (IDDA)** dataset.

## ðŸ“Š About the Project
Native American women face compounded economic disadvantages due to their identity. This project examines:
- **Income disparities** between Native and non-Native populations.
- **Gender-based wage gaps** on Native lands.

The interactive data story visualizes these disparities through **charts and graphs** generated using `ggplot` and `ai2html`.

## ðŸ“š Data Source
This project is based on **IDDA Native Areas Dataset**, which includes over **70,000 statistics** on income distributions among Native and non-Native populations. Learn more about IDDA [here](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/2023/understanding-and-interpreting-native-incomes-in-idda).

## ðŸ’¡ Methodology
To explore the intersectional barriers faced by Native American women in economic mobility, I selected income data from Native lands. The file "native-gender.csv" compares the gender wage gap on Native lands, while "native-racial.csv" examines income disparities between Native and non-Native populations. I chose the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles to represent income distribution across different levels and provide a comprehensive picture. Additionally, I included the 98th percentile as it highlights the greatest disparities at higher income levels.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Findings
- Native women earn significantly less than their male and non-Native counterparts, regardless of income percentile.
- The racial income gap on Native lands persists despite economic development efforts.
- Historical policies, such as land allocation laws, have had long-term effects on wealth accumulation for Native women.
